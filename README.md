# originalPortfolioQM

Created as my final project for the introduction to web technologies. Created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and database used is SQL. 

## Key functionality

### Displays my information and skills
Put simply, has all the key components for a student protfolio. From education specifics to specific skills relating to programming and interpersonal abilities.

### Log in and Register
Allows external users to be able to register and log in to the website handled by PHP sessions and cookies so they are able to interact on a blog that is also a part of the portfolio.

### Post blog entires and viewing blog entries
Allows users to be able to make blog entires and then they show up in the feed for all to see. This is done using an SQL query that then sorts the data in ascending order
